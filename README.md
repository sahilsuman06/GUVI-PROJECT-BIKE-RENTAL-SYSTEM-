WE HAVE CREATED A BIKE RENTAL SYSTEM USING JAVA WHICH HELPS A BIKE RENTING AGENCY TO AUTOMATE THEIR WORK.
INITIALLY AFTER RUNNING OUR PROJECT YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH VARIOUS OPTIONS.
YOU CAN SELECT TO RENT A BIKE OR CHECK THE STOCK.
IF YOU SELECT TO RENT A BIKE YOU WILL BE ASKED TO CHOOSE THE QUANITY.
WHILE RETURNING THE BIKES THE SYSTEM WILL CALCULATE YOUR FAIR AND SHOW  IT AND EXIT THE PROGRAM.
